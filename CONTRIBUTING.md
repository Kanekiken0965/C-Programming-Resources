## Contributing Guidelines

This resources are for C Programming newbies so add reources accordingly

## Don't do this
1. Don't add too much resources
2.  Don't search on the internet for resources and add that just for the sake of making PR
3.  Don't just paste the resources link without adding description

## Do This
1. Only Add the resources that you have followed
2.  Also give description about the resources in short so that one can undestand what's good about it
3.   Add resources in format
>> **'['CHANNEL-NAME/AUTHOR-NAME']'('LINK-TO-THE-CONTENT')'add-description-now**
4. If you add books then make sure you upload the PDF on [Books Folder](/Books)
5. **Once again I repeat, Only ADD Resources that you have followed**
